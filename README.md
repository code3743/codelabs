# Codelabs - Software Development 3 (DS3)

This repository contains all the **codelabs developed during the Software Development 3 (DS3)** course. Each exercise was created and tested in class, with the goal of strengthening knowledge in:

* **Spring Boot**
* **Clean Architecture**
* **Testing**
* **Microservices**

All codelabs are functional and serve as practical implementations of the concepts learned throughout the course. Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific codelab, and contains its related Spring projects.
